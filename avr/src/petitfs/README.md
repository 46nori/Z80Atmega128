# Petit FAT File System

The files in this directory are based on the [Petit FAT File System](http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_p.html) and derived from the 
[AVR42776 Petit FatFs Example](https://start.atmel.com/#examples/AVR42776/Petit/FatFs/Example).

Specifically, the "diskio_avr.c" file has been modified to provide support for the ATmega128 microcontroller.
